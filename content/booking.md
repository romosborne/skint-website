Booking for 2017 opened at 7pm 16th August.  All places have currently been allocated, but please add yourself to the waiting list if you would like to come - we always get some cancellations.

<h3>Booking Process</h3>

Last year we tried a new booking process and seeing as how it worked so beautifully we're going to stick with it this year as well.  Those that sign up in the first half hour (7-7:30pm) will be jumbled up and allocated places in a randomised order (so that people with slower broadband don't miss out unfairly).  After 7:30pm places will be allocated in the traditional first-come-first-served basis.  You can apply for a single place or for two, so couples don't need to worry about only one of you getting a place. 

During the booking process you will need the following information.

<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Contact number</li>
    <li>Dietary requirements</li>
    <li>Where you will be travelling from (for potential lift-sharing)</li>
    <li>How you can help (first aid, workshops, playing for dancing, leading a meal, washing up, etc)</li>
    <li>Whether you intend to camp indoors or outdoors - it's the same price</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Bookings are non-transferrable</strong>
</p>

<h3>Cancellations</h3>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><strong>Refunds will be given at 75% until 30th September, and after that no refunds.</strong></div>


<p>
    It's likely that if you apply after 7:30pm you will end up on the waiting list, so be there or be square!
