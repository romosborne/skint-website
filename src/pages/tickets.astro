    <h3>Tickets and Booking</h3>

    <p>
      We're offfering 3 kinds of festival tickets. You only need one kind! You
      can book up to 2 adult places and 2 child places per customer.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Weekend ticket</strong> - Entry to the whole festival, from Friday
        evening to Sunday afternoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kids Weekend ticket</strong> - Entry is free for children under 16,
        please reserve a space using the free 'kids ticket' option. Please also buy
        meals and camping for kids as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Day / Evening tickets</strong> - If you're not joining us for the
        whole weekend, choose the times you want to come.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Accommodation and meals are optional items. This allows us to overcome the
      traditional limiting factor of Skint, catering for all of us, and allows
      you to choose which parts of Skint you want to enjoy.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Accommodation</strong> - Choose from indoor camping (sleeping in
        the hall) or outdoor camping (bring a tent or campervan). Breakfast is provided
        for all indoor and outdoor campers
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Food</strong> - You need a ticket for each meal - Friday dinner,
        Saturday lunch, Saturday dinner, and Sunday lunch.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you forget any optional items when you first book, please fill in the
      booking form again using the free 'placeholder ticket' option. This is
      because the booking system won't let you buy meals and accommodation
      without tickets. Please note the placeholder ticket is not valid for entry
      to the festival!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you haven't bought meal tickets, you are welcome to bring your own
      food. We will provide seating space for those self-catering to eat packed
      lunches, but there will be no food storage or cooking facilities
      available. There are also some fantastic pubs in the village that serve
      food, as well as a small shop.
    </p>

    <p>
      For off-festival accommodation and food suggestions, take a look at the <a

      </a> page
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        Tickets are non-transferrable, including meal and camping tickets.
      </strong> Names must be provided for each place, as tickets are only valid
      for the named person. You cannot sell or give them to someone else. This is
      to make the booking process fair for everyone. We reserve the right to cancel
      tickets obtained in contravention of the rules
    </p>

    <h3>Discounts and Donations</h3>

    <p>
      We want Skint to be accessible to everyone. If you're struggling with the
      cost of attending, please use the discount code REALLYSKINT for an
      automatic Â£10 off the ticket price. We also have a small fund to support
      people to come who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it, even with the
      discount. If that's you, please <a href="/contactus">get in touch</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if you can afford a bit more we're offering the option
      to 'sponsor a Skinter' by adding a donation when you book.
    </p>

    <h3>Cancellations and Refunds</h3>

    <p>
      If your circumstances change & you are unable to attend Skint, please let
      us know <a href="mailto:skint.dance@gmail.com">by email</a>
    </p>

    <p>Cancellations up to 30th September - 75% refund.</p>
    <p>Concellations from 1st October - no refund will be given.</p>

    <h3>Waiting list</h3>

    <p>We are NOT operating a waiting list for tickets!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If festival tickets become available due to cancellations they will
        immediately become available on the booking site, so please check back
        there.
      </li>
      <li>
        Releasing meal tickets is a manual process, so cancelled meal tickets
        won't appear automatically. Instead, we will release any available meal
        tickets at a few weeks prior to Skint.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All tickets are being sold online. If day or evening tickets are sold out
      online, there won't be any extra to buy on the door so please buy your
      tickets before you come.
    </p>
